## 🚀 New Features Overview

This update adds significant enhancements to your IoT controller system, including automatic water level monitoring, improved LCD display with scrolling text, and a redesigned mobile app interface.

## 🔌 Hardware Updates

### Water Sensor Integration
- **Automatic Monitoring**: Continuously monitors water levels every second
- **Emergency Triggering**: Automatically activates emergency alerts when water level exceeds threshold
- **Independent Operation**: Works separately from manual emergency controls
- **Threshold Settings**: Configurable high/low water level thresholds

### LCD Display Enhancements
- **Scrolling Text**: Long messages scroll horizontally like a digital billboard
- **Status Information**: Shows water sensor readings and system status
- **Emergency Priority**: Emergency messages override normal scrolling
- **Smooth Animation**: Configurable scroll speed and padding

## 📱 Mobile App Improvements

### Simplified Interface
- **No Admin Fields**: Removed complex admin ID requirements
- **One-Tap Emergency**: Simple emergency activation/deactivation buttons
- **Expandable Sections**: Hide/show details to reduce clutter
- **Modern Design**: Updated UI with better visual hierarchy

### Warning Alert System
- **Admin Notifications**: Centralized alert display for system administrators
- **Multiple Severity Levels**: Info, Warning, and Critical alerts
- **Dismissible Alerts**: Individual alert management
- **Source Tracking**: Shows whether alerts come from water sensor, manual triggers, or system

### Emergency Control Improvements
- **Manual vs Automatic**: Clear separation between manual and water sensor emergencies
- **Status Display**: Visual indicators for different emergency types
- **Independent Control**: Manual emergency doesn't interfere with water sensor alerts

## 🎛️ Technical Specifications

### Water Sensor Configuration
```cpp
// Configurable thresholds in Arduino code
const int WATER_THRESHOLD_HIGH = 700;  // Trigger emergency
const int WATER_THRESHOLD_LOW = 300;   // Return to normal
const unsigned long WATER_CHECK_INTERVAL = 1000;  // Check every second
```

### LCD Scrolling Settings
```cpp
const unsigned long SCROLL_DELAY = 300;  // Milliseconds between scroll steps
String scrollText = text + "    ";       // Padding for smooth scrolling
```

### Pin Assignments
- **Water Sensor**: Analog pin A0
- **Emergency LED**: Digital pin 7 (with 220Ω resistor)
- **Buzzer**: Digital pin 8
- **LCD**: I2C (A4/SDA, A5/SCL)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup
1. Connect water sensor to Arduino pin A0 (signal), 5V (power), and GND
2. Ensure existing emergency LED and buzzer connections remain intact
3. Verify I2C LCD connections for scrolling functionality
4. Test all connections before powering on

### 2. Arduino Code Upload
1. Upload the updated `arduino_controller.ino` to your Arduino
2. Verify serial communication at 9600 baud
3. Test water sensor readings in serial monitor
4. Adjust thresholds if needed based on your sensor type

### 3. Mobile App Update
1. Build and install the updated Android app
2. Test new expandable interface sections
3. Verify emergency controls work independently
4. Check water level monitoring in status section

## 🚨 Emergency System Behavior

### Water Sensor Emergency
- **Trigger**: When water level > 700 (configurable)
- **Actions**: LED flashing + siren + LCD message "Water level high"
- **Auto-Deactivation**: When water level drops below 300
- **Message**: Shows "** WATER ALERT **" on LCD

### Manual Emergency
- **Trigger**: User activates via app button
- **Actions**: LED flashing + siren + LCD message "EMERGENCY ACTIVATED"
- **Deactivation**: Manual via app or 30-second timeout
- **Independence**: Does not interfere with water sensor alerts

### Combined Emergency
- Both systems can be active simultaneously
- Each has its own status indicator in the app
- Water emergency auto-resolves when water level normalizes
- Manual emergency requires explicit deactivation

## 📊 Monitoring & Status

### Real-Time Information
- Water level readings updated every 5 seconds
- Connection status for Internet, Firebase, and Device
- Emergency status for Manual, Water Sensor, and Overall
- Last seen timestamp for device connectivity

### Alert Management
- Warning alerts appear for admin users
- Alerts can be dismissed individually
- Different severity levels with color coding
- Source attribution (water_sensor, manual, system)

## 🎯 Usage Tips

### Optimal Water Sensor Placement
- Position sensor to detect flooding or high water levels
- Ensure sensor can reach both normal and emergency water levels
- Protect sensor connections from moisture
- Test with actual water to verify thresholds

### LCD Message Best Practices
- Short messages display normally (≤16 characters)
- Long messages automatically scroll horizontally
- Emergency messages always take priority
- Status line shows water level and connection info

### App Interface Navigation
- Start with Status section expanded to check system health
- Use Emergency Control for manual alerts
- Collapse Device Controls to save space when not needed
- Monitor Warning Alerts section for system notifications

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Water Sensor Issues
- **No readings**: Check connections to A0, 5V, and GND
- **False alerts**: Adjust WATER_THRESHOLD_HIGH value
- **Not sensitive**: Lower WATER_THRESHOLD_HIGH value
- **Constant alerts**: Check sensor placement and wiring

### LCD Display Problems
- **No scrolling**: Verify text length > 16 characters
- **Too fast/slow**: Adjust SCROLL_DELAY value
- **Garbled text**: Check I2C connections and LCD power
- **Emergency stuck**: Restart Arduino to clear emergency state

### App Connectivity
- **Sections not expanding**: Check for compile errors
- **Emergency buttons disabled**: Verify internet connection
- **No water readings**: Ensure Arduino is sending WATER_LEVEL messages
- **Missing alerts**: Check Firebase database permissions

## 📋 Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly Checks
- Verify water sensor cleanliness
- Test emergency activation/deactivation
- Check all connection status indicators
- Review any warning alerts

### Monthly Tasks
- Clean water sensor probes
